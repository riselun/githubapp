## Features

### User Features
- Browse trending GitHub repositories without login
- View repository details including stars, forks, language, and issues
- Search repositories by name and filter by programming language
- Login with GitHub personal access token
- View personal profile and repositories
- Create issues for repositories
- Support for both portrait and landscape modes
- Proper error handling for network issues

### Technical Features
- Modern Android architecture with MVVM pattern
- Jetpack Compose UI
- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Dependency Injection with Hilt
- GitHub REST API integration
- Persistent authentication using DataStore
- Unit tests and UI tests

## Architecture

The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and is organized into the following layers:

### Data Layer
- **API**: Interfaces and implementations for the GitHub REST API
- **Models**: Data classes representing GitHub entities
- **Repository**: Single source of truth for the application data
- **Local**: Local storage for user preferences and authentication

### UI Layer
- **Screens**: Composable UI screens for different features
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Components**: Reusable UI components

### DI Layer
- **AppModule**: Dependency injection setup with Hilt

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Local Storage**: DataStore
- **Testing**: JUnit, Espresso

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox (2021.3.1) or newer
- JDK 11 or newer
- Android SDK 29+

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

## Testing

The application includes both unit tests and UI tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Located in the `app/src/test` directory
- **UI Tests**: Located in the `app/src/androidTest` directory

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run UI tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX
- Material Design principles for consistent and modern UI
- Dark mode support for better user experience
- Responsive layout for both portrait and landscape orientations

### Architecture
- Clean Architecture principles for separation of concerns
- Repository pattern for data management
- ViewModel for UI state management
- Dependency Injection for better testability

### Security
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- No hardcoded credentials
- Proper error handling for security-related issues

## Future Improvements

- Add support for GitHub OAuth authentication
- Implement pagination for repository and issue lists
- Add support for pull requests
- Enhance offline capabilities
- Add more advanced search filters
- Implement GitHub Actions integration
