# GitHub Android Application Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architectural design and key decisions made for the GitHub Android Application. The application allows users to browse GitHub content, search repositories, view repository details, and interact with GitHub using their account.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Clean Architecture principles. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

### 2.1 Architecture Layers

#### 2.1.1 Presentation Layer (UI)
- **Screens**: Jetpack Compose UI components
- **ViewModels**: Manage UI state and handle user interactions
- **UI State**: Immutable state objects representing the UI state

#### 2.1.2 Domain Layer
- **Repository Interfaces**: Define the contract for data operations
- **Use Cases**: Business logic operations (implicit in our implementation)

#### 2.1.3 Data Layer
- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces
- **Remote Data Source**: GitHub API client
- **Local Data Source**: User preferences and authentication storage

### 2.2 Key Components

#### 2.2.1 Dependency Injection
Hilt is used for dependency injection, providing a standard way to incorporate dependency injection into the application.

#### 2.2.2 Navigation
Jetpack Navigation Compose is used for navigation between screens, providing a type-safe way to navigate and pass arguments.

#### 2.2.3 State Management
Each ViewModel exposes UI state as a StateFlow, allowing the UI to reactively update based on state changes.

## 3. Design Patterns

### 3.1 Repository Pattern
The repository pattern is used to abstract the data sources from the rest of the application. This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., API, local database) without affecting the rest of the application.

### 3.2 Observer Pattern
StateFlow is used to implement the observer pattern, allowing the UI to observe state changes and update accordingly.

### 3.3 Factory Pattern
Hilt uses the factory pattern to create instances of dependencies.

## 4. Authentication Flow

The application uses token-based authentication with GitHub's Personal Access Tokens:

1. User enters their GitHub Personal Access Token
2. Token is validated by making an API call to fetch the user profile
3. If successful, the token is stored securely in DataStore
4. The authentication state is exposed as a Flow, allowing the UI to react to changes in authentication state

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 Repository Browsing Flow
1. UI requests data from ViewModel
2. ViewModel requests data from Repository
3. Repository fetches data from GitHub API
4. Data is transformed and returned to ViewModel
5. ViewModel updates UI state
6. UI recomposes based on the new state

### 5.2 Search Flow
1. User enters search query
2. Search query is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
3. ViewModel requests search results from Repository
4. Repository fetches search results from GitHub API
5. Results are transformed and returned to ViewModel
6. ViewModel updates UI state
7. UI recomposes to display search results

## 6. Error Handling

The application uses a centralized error handling approach:

1. Errors are caught at the Repository level
2. Errors are transformed into user-friendly messages using NetworkUtils
3. Error messages are included in the UI state
4. UI displays error messages and provides retry options

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing
Unit tests focus on testing the business logic in isolation:
- Repository tests
- ViewModel tests

### 7.2 UI Testing
UI tests focus on testing the UI components and their interactions:
- Screen tests using Compose testing APIs
- Navigation tests

### 7.3 Integration Testing
Integration tests focus on testing the integration between different components:
- Repository integration with API
- ViewModel integration with Repository

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Network Optimization
- Debouncing search queries
- Caching API responses

### 8.2 UI Performance
- Using Compose's lazy components for efficient list rendering
- Minimizing recompositions

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 Authentication
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- No hardcoded credentials

### 9.2 Network Security
- HTTPS for all network requests
- Proper error handling for security-related issues

## 10. Future Improvements

### 10.1 Features
- GitHub OAuth authentication
- Pull request support
- GitHub Actions integration
- Offline support

### 10.2 Technical Improvements
- Pagination for repository and issue lists
- More comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
